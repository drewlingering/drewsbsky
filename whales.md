# 🌊 Blue Whale Conservation Status

Not extinct — but definitely endangered. The **blue whale** (*Balaenoptera musculus*) is still with us, though its population has been drastically reduced due to past whaling, ship strikes, fishing gear entanglement, and climate-related threats.

---

## 🌍 Current Status

- **Conservation Status**: *Endangered* (IUCN Red List)
- **Estimated Population**: Between **10,000 and 25,000 individuals** globally
- **Habitat**: Found in all major oceans except the Arctic — often migrating between polar feeding grounds and tropical breeding areas

---

## ⚠️ Threats

- **Historic Whaling**: Over 350,000 blue whales were killed between 1904 and 1967
- **Ship Collisions**: Despite their size, they’re vulnerable to vessel strikes
- **Fishing Gear**: Ghost nets and abandoned gear can entangle whales
- **Noise Pollution**: Disrupts long-distance communication and navigation

---

## 🌱 Conservation Efforts

- **Whaling Ban**: Commercial hunting of blue whales was banned in 1966
- **Protected Areas**: Marine sanctuaries and migration corridors are being expanded
- **Monitoring**: Satellite tracking and acoustic surveys help understand movement and risks

## 🌬️ Ecological Importance

Blue whales play a pivotal role in **ocean carbon cycling** by fertilizing plankton blooms through nutrient-rich waste. Their survival indirectly supports biodiversity and climate stability.

---

**TL;DR**: The blue whale is not extinct, but its future depends on sustained conservation and awareness. It's an ecological heavyweight whose presence keeps marine ecosystems in balance.
