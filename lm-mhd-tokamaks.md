# ðŸ”§ Tokamak Designs with Liquid Metal MHD Walls

Liquid metal walls are explored to improve plasma-material interaction, heat removal, and self-healing capabilities in tokamaks. These designs are mostly experimental but show promise for next-gen reactors.

## ðŸ”¬ Notable Experiments and Concepts

### **CDX-U (USA)**
- Tested **static lithium films** and **capillary porous systems**.
- Managed heat loads up to **60 MW/mÂ²** in short bursts.
- Explored **evaporative shielding** and **natural convection**.

### **NSTX (USA)**
- Utilized **lithium coatings** to reduce recycling and improve confinement.
- Investigated **liquid lithium limiters** and retention surfaces.

### **T-11M (Russia)**
- Conducted long-term tests with **liquid lithium under high fluence**.
- Studied **hydrogen retention**, **helium bubble dynamics**, and surface rejuvenation.

### **Zakharov's Concept**
- Proposed a **full lithium wall** driven by **JÃ—B forces
