## üí° Why It Matters

Liquid metal systems could solve persistent issues with solid PFCs like tungsten:
- **Erosion resistance**
- **Neutron damage tolerance**
- **Passive heat removal**
- **Hydrogen inventory control**

These ideas feed into future fusion designs where **steady-state operation**, **tritium self-sufficiency**, and **compact layouts** are key.
