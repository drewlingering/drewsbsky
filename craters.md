## 🧠 Notes

- **Vredefort** is the largest confirmed impact structure on Earth — though deeply eroded.
- **Chicxulub** is famous for its role in the dinosaur extinction event.
- Some sizes are estimates due to erosion, sedimentation, or partial exposure.
- Dates are approximate based on radiometric dating and stratigraphic analysis.

**TL;DR**: The largest confirmed impact craters range from 52 km to 300 km wide, and span over 2 billion years of planetary history. These sites reveal Earth's violent past and shape our understanding of mass extinctions, geology, and even planetary defense.
