# 🌾 Dinosaurs and Grass: Rethinking Prehistoric Diets

The notion that dinosaurs roamed a grassless Earth is outdated. Fossil evidence from the mid-Cretaceous reveals that **true grasses (Poaceae)** existed around **110 million years ago**, offering new perspectives on prehistoric diets and ecosystems.

## 🧬 Timeline of Grass Evolution
- **~110–113 Mya**: Grass fossils (phytoliths) appear in the mid-Cretaceous.
- Found in **coprolites** (fossilized dung) from sauropods like **titanosaurs**.

## 🦕 Dinosaurs That Likely Ate Grass
- **Titanosaurs**: Coprolite evidence shows multiple types of grass phytoliths.
- **Hadrosaurs**: Duck-billed grazers with dental batteries fit for tough vegetation.
- **Equijubus normani**: Early hadrosauroid with grass fragments in tooth wear.

## 🍽️ Digestive Adaptations
- **Grinding teeth**, **elongated guts**, and **gastroliths** supported fibrous plant digestion.
- Diets included **ferns, cycads, conifers**, and early **angiosperms**, alongside grasses.

## 🌍 Ecosystem Impact
- Challenges the idea of a grassless dinosaur era.
- Suggests **coevolution** between herbivores and emerging grasses.
- Opens new questions about prehistoric landscapes and grazing dynamics.

> Even bamboo—often mistaken for a tree—is a grass. Its evolutionary roots strengthen the case that ancestral grassy plants could have shaped Cretaceous ecosystems in ways we’re just beginning to understand.
