Here's a precise listing of **extant power systems** using **90%+ enriched uranium (HEU)**, focusing strictly on operational or historically operational **military and research reactors** where such enrichment levels are used for propulsion or power—not weapons.

## ⚓ Military Power Systems Using 90%+ Enrichment

| Platform Type | Country | Reactor Name/Class | Enrichment Level | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|--------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Submarine** | USA     | Ohio-class SSBN     | ~93.5% U-235     | Propulsion |
| **Submarine** | USA     | Virginia-class SSN  | ~93.5% U-235     | Propulsion |
| **Aircraft Carrier** | USA | Nimitz-class & Ford-class | ~93.5% U-235 | Propulsion |
| **Submarine** | UK      | Vanguard-class SSBN | ~93.5% U-235     | Propulsion |
| **Submarine** | UK      | Astute-class SSN    | ~93.5% U-235     | Propulsion |
| **Submarine** | Russia  | Some legacy classes (e.g. Alfa) | Up to 90%+ | Propulsion (historical) |
| **Submarine** | India   | Arihant-class SSBN  | Believed to be HEU | Propulsion (details classified) |

> Note: France and China use **LEU (<20%)** for naval propulsion, not HEU.

## 🧪 Research Reactors Using 90%+ Enrichment (Power-Oriented)

These are **non-electricity-generating** but still qualify as power systems due to their neutron flux or isotope production roles.

| Reactor Name | Country | Enrichment | Purpose | Status |
|--------------|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| **MITR-II** (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) | USA | ~93% U-235 | Neutron flux for research | Operational (conversion planned) |
| **BR2** (Belgium) | Belgium | ~93% U-235 | Materials testing, isotope production | Operational (conversion underway) |
| **FRM-II** (Germany) | Germany | ~93% U-235 | Neutron source | Operational (controversial) |
| **IRR-1** (Israel) | Israel | ~90%+ U-235 | Research, isotope production | Operational (details classified) |
| **NIRR-1** (Nigeria) | Nigeria | ~90% U-235 | Research | Operational (conversion planned) |

> Many of these are part of the **Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI)** aiming to convert to LEU. Some have resisted due to performance constraints.

## 🧭 Summary

- **Military naval reactors** are the **only extant power systems** using 90%+ HEU for sustained propulsion.
- **Research reactors** using HEU are **not electricity-generating**, but they are power systems in the sense of high neutron flux and isotope production.
- No **civilian electricity-generating reactor** uses HEU due to proliferation risks and regulatory constraints.

Would you like a speculative model of what a civilian HEU power system might look like—say, for deep-space propulsion or ultra-compact off-grid reactors?
